1. Struggle First – Try solving for 30-45 mins before watching solutions.
2. Start Easy – Build confidence before tackling hard problems.
3. Make It Real – Relate problems to real-world applications.
4. Gamify It – Use LeetCode, CodeChef, and contests for fun learning.
5. Join a Community – Discuss with peers to stay motivated.
6. Track Progress – Maintain a log to see improvements.
7. Stick to Java – Use your preferred language for comfort.

"Struggle First" helps you develop problem-solving skills rather than just memorizing solutions. Here's how:

Active Thinking – Your brain tries different approaches, improving logical reasoning.
Pattern Recognition – You start seeing common tricks in problems over time.
Stronger Retention – Solutions you figure out yourself stick longer in memory.
Boosts Confidence – Solving without help gives a sense of achievement.
Develops Patience – You get comfortable with handling tough problems.
If you're completely stuck, break it down:

Think of brute-force first.
Try small test cases manually.
Identify similar problems you've solved before.
